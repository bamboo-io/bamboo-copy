## What is BAM Rewards?

Bamboo gives users the opportunity to earn rewards based on in-app activity. Rewards are paid in BAM tokens and can be sold for cash at any point. When users activate rewards and maintain 2% of the BAM in your portfolio users are eligible to get BAM rewards.

## What is $BAM?

BAM is the native reward token used on the Bamboo platform used as a unit of account.

## How to qualify for rewards?

Activating the ‘Activate Rewards’ button in the rewards section of the app.

Allocating 2% of BAM in your portfolio at a value of at least $50. Then, maintain 2% of BAM in your portfolio, ongoing.

The purchase of BAM is fully tradable and can be sold down proportionally to your portfolio at any time. In the future, users will have the option to rebalance rewards for BTC and ETH.

## Extra information

Once users enable extra rewards, we will automatically maintain at least 2% BAM in the portfolio mix.

This means, in some circumstances when doing a round-up, top-up, or recurring payment we may add additional BAM to the purchase to meet the 2% threshold in order to earn BAM rewards.

## FAQs

**Can I redeem/sell BAM?**

You can sell BAM at any time proportionally to your portfolio. Our roadmap includes a feature to have a single asset sell to make it easy to sell/rebalance BAM individually.

**Can I transfer my BAM on/off the App?**

No, unfortunately, Bamboo is a ‘closed loop’ system meaning you can only sell down your digital assets to your bank account.

**What is burning BAM?**

There are 75,000,000 BAM tokens in circulation and the burning of BAM will reduce the supply of BAM over time. Bamboo purchases BAM off the open market and the internal app market for burning. The interim burning target is 750,000 BAM equating to 1% of the total supply.

**What else can I use the token for?**

This is the first iteration of the BAM token implementation and there will be more utility provided in the future.
