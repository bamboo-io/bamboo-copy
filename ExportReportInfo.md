## For SMSF Users

If you manage a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF), you'll need to prepare specific reports for tax purposes at the end of each financial year.

**Guide for SMSF account owners:**

1. **Export your transaction report**  
   - **First-time export:** select “**Since start**” so Crypto Tax Calculator receives your full transaction history and can establish an accurate cost base. 
   - **Later exports:** choose the specific financial year you need.
   - Set the report format to **Crypto Tax Calculator CSV** and tap **Continue**.

2. **Use [Crypto Tax Calculator (CTC)](https://home.cryptotaxcalculator.io/au)**  
   - Upload the CTC CSV file directly into the software.  
   - It will automatically categorize transactions and you can then generate your tax reports.
   - Consult your tax advisor to ensure compliance with current taxation laws. The information provided does not take into account individual taxpayers' circumstances, and we are unable to provide tax advice.

3. **Need Help?**

If you're working with an accountant, simply send them the exported file.
