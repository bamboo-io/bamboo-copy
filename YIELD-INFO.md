## Learn more about earning interest

Bamboo gives you the opportunity to earn interest on digital currency. Currently, we only provide interest on Bitcoin and/or Ethereum. 

The default interest rate is 3% APY on  Bitcoin and Ethereum calculated and issued every 24 hours. You can earn extra interest for maintaining 2% of BAM in your portfolio. 

**How it works**

Each day at midnight the system checks the amount of BTC and ETH in your portfolio, calculates interest and adds it to your asset value. 

**Please note:** Interest is calculated on a rolling 24 hour period beginning at GMT 00.00.  If you make a withdrawal, you will not be provided with the yield for the current period, but rather just the previous full 24 hour period.  

You can view the information about interest earned in the following sections:

- Activity tab - at the top there is the Total Yield Earned showing how much you earned in the current financial year in AUD;
- Earn tab - your interest percentage and the earned amount for each crypto;
- Settings > Investment Report - your yield earned within a selected period of time (both in AUD and crypto).

**How to earn extra interest?**

You can earn extra interest (8%) on your cryptocurrency when you own BAM tokens. You can purchase BAM tokens directly from the Earn tab by tapping 'Earn extra interest' toggle or by modifying your portfolio mix.

**Please note:** You will earn extra interest only when both conditions are met:

- you maintain 2% BAM in your portfolio mix;
- you have successfully purchased BAM.
