## Portfolio Composition

Your portfolio composition is what assets you want to invest with Bamboo.

Making changes here won’t impact your current portfolio, just how the composition of your investments into your Bamboo portfolio will be distributed moving forward.

**How does it work?**

You have 100 points to assign to assets that you'd like to invest in. From now on Bamboo will invest in your chosen assets proportionately, based on how you’ve assigned those 100 points. If you have a portfolio with 100 points assigned to Bitcoin and you'd like to add Ethereum to it, simply remove 50 points from Bitcoin and add them to Ethereum. This will mean your future allocations will be 50/50.
