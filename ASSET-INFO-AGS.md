## Silver
Pure Silver Bullion. Weâ€™ve matched 1 AGS token to 1 Gram of Silver provided through the Gold Silver Standard.

A reality of dealing with a token fully backed by real physical bullion is that there are real costs in doing so. As such the sale of gold includes a spread of 7.3%. As such we recommend you approach investment in these assets with a long term mindset.

Note that Bamboo does not take any profit from this spread, the spread covers the costs in refining, production and handling of pure bullion.

You will note silver has higher spreads than gold. The gold price is around 85 times higher than silver but the costs of bullion production are similar. Silver is also more expensive to refine, freight and store. In percentage terms this presents as higher spreads. This is normal in bullion trading.

While under management all AGS tokens are fully guaranteed using our Proof of Solvency protocol.
