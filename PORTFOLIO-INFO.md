## Portfolio Composition

Your portfolio's composition lets you decide how your **future** installments will be invested.

Importantly, *it does not change the composition of your current portfolio*. We'll be launching portfolio rebalancing feature soon to allow you to do this. Keep an eye on our [roadmap](https://www.getbamboo.io/roadmap).

**How does it work?**

You have 100 points to assign to your portfolio. Once you have assigned all 100 points to the assets you are interested in, for all **future** installments we will invest in your assets proportionately based on this selection.

If you have a portfolio with 100 points assigned to Bitcoin and you would like future investments to be split evenly between Gold and Bitcoin you would simply deduct 50 points from Bitcoin and add them to Gold.

**Example**
You decide to compose your portfolio of Gold, Bitcoin and Silver as follows;
- Gold (40 points)
- Bitcoin (40 points)
- Silver (20 points)

You then deposit $100.

We will look at your current portfolio selection and invest;
- $40 in Gold
- $40 in Bitcoin
- $20 in Silver

You now decide you would like to add Ethereum to your portfolio. You deduct 20 points from Bitcoin and assign them to Ethereum leaving your with a portfolio of;
- Gold (40 points)
- Bitcoin (20 points)
- Ethereum (20 points)
- Silver (20 points)

You then deposit a further $100.

We will now invest;
- $40 in Gold
- $20 in Bitcoin
- $20 in Ethereum
- $20 in Silver

At this point your portfolio is now invested as;
- $80 in Gold (40%)
- $60 in Bitcoin (30%)
- $40 in Silver (20%)
- $20 in Ethereum (10%)

Notice how the current portfolio breakdown is different than your chosen portfolio composition. This is because the portfolio composition only affects **future** investments.

Keep an eye out for portfolio rebalancing where we will allow you to rebalance your portfolio to have a selected breakdown. We haven't enabled this yet as it is a taxable event, so we want to ensure our customers understand the implications fully.
