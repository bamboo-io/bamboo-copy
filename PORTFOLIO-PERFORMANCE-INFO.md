##Total Portfolio Value (AUD)


**Total Portfolio Value (AUD)** shows the value of all your assets in fiat based on the latest sell price:

Sum of (Asset amount * Latest Asset sell price) - withdrawal fee

Please note: cryptocurrency is very volatile so your Total Portfolio Value might change every 10-15 seconds.


##TPV Performance (AUD)


The performance for TPV is calculated **for all time**, covering the entire period of your investment journey.

It is calculated based on the Dollar Cost Average (DCA) price using the formula:
Total Portfolio Value - (DCA * Total volume purchased)

DCA is calculated taking into account each purchase you make over time:
((Transaction 1 price * Transaction 1 volume) + (Transaction 2
price * Transaction 2 volume))/Total volume

The dollar cost average is the weighted average price (VWAP) and describes a trading benchmark that gives the average price an asset which has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price. It is important because it provides insight into both the trend and value of an asset.

Please note that the performance is also based on an internal rate of return which is a metric used to estimate the profitability. It is the annual rate of growth that an investment is expected to generate.

##Asset Performance (AUD)
Performance metrics for individual assets are calculated **on a daily basis**, reflecting each day's specific price movements.
