## Portfolio Composition

Choose which assets you want Bamboo to invest in.

Making changes here won’t impact the composition of your current portfolio, just how Bamboo invests in the future.

**How does it work?**

You have 100 points to assign to assets that you'd like to invest in. From now on Bamboo will invest in your chosen assets proportionately, based on how you’ve assigned those 100 points.


If you have a portfolio with 100 points assigned to Bitcoin and you'd like future investments to be split evenly between Gold and Bitcoin simply remove 50 points from Bitcoin and add them to Gold.

**Example**  
You decide to compose your portfolio of Gold, Bitcoin and Silver as follows:
- Gold
- Bitcoin
- Silver

You then deposit $100.
