## Invest

Top-ups are an easy way to get funds into Bamboo without waiting for your round-up meter to fill.

Top-up to reach your goals faster and benefit from Dollar Cost Averaging.

Dollar Cost Averaging is an investment technique which involves buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule. No more worrying about having to invest at the right time.


## How does it work?

There are two ways to top-up your portfolio.

1. You can convert your assets from USDC which is $USD denominated Stable Coin. You can learn more about USDC Stable Coin here on our [Blog](https://www.getbamboo.io/blog/Understanding-USDC/).
2. Invest via your bank account with the direct debit. When you top-up this way, a direct debit is issued to your funding account. If you have sufficient funds, we will immediately schedule an asset purchase for you. After 1-3 bank days you should see a direct debit from "Bamboo 61" on your funding account statement.

The minimum Top-up is $50 AUD, with a daily limit of $550. It is possible to request a higher daily limit based on your in-app activities.
