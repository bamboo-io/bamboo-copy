## Asset Distribution

Choose which assets you want Bamboo to invest in.

**How does it work?**

You have 100 points to assign to assets that you'd like to invest in. From now on Bamboo will invest in your chosen assets proportionately, based on how youâ€™ve assigned those 100 points. This does not rebalance your portfolio.


If you have a portfolio with 100 points assigned to Bitcoin and you'd like future investments to be split evenly between Gold and Bitcoin simply remove 50 points from Bitcoin and add them to Gold.

**Example**  
You decide to compose your portfolio of Gold, Bitcoin and Silver as follows:
- Gold
- Bitcoin
- Silver

You then deposit $100. We then allocate your $100 proportionally to these three assets.
