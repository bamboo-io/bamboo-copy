### Recurring Top-ups are an easy way to get funds into Bamboo regularly without waiting for your round-up meter to fill.

Top-up to reach your **Goals Faster** and benefit from  **Dollar Cost Averaging.**

Dollar Cost Averaging is an investment technique which involves buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule. No more worrying about having to invest at the right time.

### How does it work?

When you top-up, a direct debit is issued to your funding account. If you have sufficient funds, we will immediately schedule an asset purchase for you. After 1-3 bank days you should see a direct debit from “Bamboo 61” on your funding account statement.

The minimum Top-up is $50 AUD, with a daily limit of $500 and a monthly limit of $2,500.
