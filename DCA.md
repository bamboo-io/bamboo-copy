# Dollar Cost Averaging

Dollar Cost Averaging, more commonly referred to as DCA, is an investment strategy developed for investors who don’t have the time or knowledge to trade markets effectively. Dollar-cost averaging involves investing a set amount of money into your portfolio on a scheduled basis, irrelevant of current price or market movements. This means you’ll occasionally buy at a high price and sometimes at a low price, but in the long run, it’ll even out.

When you DCA, you reduce the risk of suffering large losses while at the same time sacrificing the potential for large gains. It may be less exciting than trying to buy the dips and sell the tops, but it’s far safer if you don’t know what you’re doing.
