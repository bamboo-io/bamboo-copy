### Recurring Top-ups are an easy way to get funds into Bamboo regularly without waiting for your round-up meter to fill.
  
  
Top-up to reach your **Goals Faster** and benefit from **Dollar Cost Averaging**.

Dollar Cost Averaging is an investment technique which involves buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule. No more worrying about having to invest at the right time.
  
  
### How does it work?
  
When you schedule a top-up, a direct debit is issued to your funding account on the nominated day. If you have sufficient funds, once the direct debit clears we will immediately invest into your portfolio based on the selected portfolio composition.

Please note that it can take between 1-3 banking days for your Direct Debit to clear after leaving your bank account depending on your bank.

The minimum Recurring Top-up is $%MINIMUM%, with a weekly limit of $%WEEKLY_LIMIT%, a fortnightly limit of $%FORTNIGHTLY_LIMIT% a monthly limit of $%MONTHLY_LIMIT%.
