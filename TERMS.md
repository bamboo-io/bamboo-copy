### 5. Risks
#### 5.1 Risks
By using the Application, you warrant that you understand and accept the following risks:

* The trading of cryptographic assets involves significant risk.
*  Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your cryptographic assets at any given moment. Any currency - crypto or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. 
* Cryptographic asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with conventional currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, cryptocurrencies are a unique kind of "fiat" currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of cryptocurrencies in a crisis or issue more currency.
* Cryptographic asset are an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of cryptographic asset and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. 
* Cryptographic asset trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in cryptographic assets because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. 
* Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling. There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in this agreement. 
* We use our banking providers in order to receive Fiat Currency and remit the value of your Assets to you. Our banking providers do not transfer cryptocurrencies, exchange cryptocurrencies, or provide any services in connection with cryptocurrencies.

You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading cryptographic assets.
