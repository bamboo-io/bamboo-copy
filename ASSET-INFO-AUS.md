## Gold

Pure Gold Bullion. Weâ€™ve matched 1 AUS token to 1 Gram of Gold provided through the Gold Silver Standard.

A reality of dealing with a token **fully** backed by real physical bullion is that there are real costs in doing so. A consequence of this is that the sale of gold includes a spread of 3.5%. As such we recommend you approach investment in these assets with a long term mindset.

Note that Bamboo does not take any profit from this spread, the spread covers the costs in refining, production and handling of pure bullion.

While under management all AUS tokens are fully guaranteed using our [Proof of Solvency](https://www.getbamboo.io/solvency-protocol) protocol.
