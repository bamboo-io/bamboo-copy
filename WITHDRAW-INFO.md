## Withdrawals
Withdrawals are a quick and convenient way to sell your digital assets and withdraw funds back to your bank account.

You can use withdrawals to lock in profit on your assets or simply reduce your investment exposure.

**How does it work?**
We calculate the portion of your digital assets required to fulfil a requested withdrawal amount and immediately execute a sale of those assets at current market pricing.

Once the assets are sold a direct debit refund is issued to your funding account. After 1-3 bank days you should see a direct debit from “Bamboo 61” on your funding account statement with the sale value of your assets, less any withdrawal fee.

Depending on market movements at the time of your sale the actual amount you receive may vary by +/- 5%.

There is no minimum withdrawal, you will simply need to withdraw enough to cover the withdrawal fee.

_Please note at present we do not allow withdrawal of underlying digital assets._
