## Ethereum

Ethereum is traded through an Australian exchange, Independent Reserve. When Ethereum is purchased on your behalf, we hold the assets with Fireblocks, one of the world's largest custodians.

Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications on the network. These additions have led many to call Ethereum “programmable money” and have ushered in a new age of technology in finance.
