# How would you like to Invest? 

Set up your "[dollar cost averaging strategy](https://www.getbamboo.io/blog/dollar-cost-averaging-101/)" by using one or both of the below features. You can turn this off or change your strategy at any time in your settings menu. 

# Round-ups:

The "Round-Ups" tool simplifies investing by automatically using your change from everyday purchases. Bamboo syncs with your bank account, rounds up transactions to your chosen dollar, and invests that change in your digital currency portfolio of your choice. This hands-off approach lets you effortlessly build your digital currency holdings with the spare change from your transactions.

For example, if you spend $4.50 on coffee, the “round-ups” tool rounds it up to $5, investing the extra $0.50 in your Bamboo portfolio.

# Recurring Top-ups:

The "Recurring Top-Ups" tool automates your investments with a fixed amount at regular intervals, implementing the dollar cost averaging investment strategy by helping you achieve the average price of the assets over time. Simply set your investment amount and frequency, and the recurring top-ups tool will run on autopilot.

For instance, if you get paid fortnightly, you can automate a $200 investment with each paycheck.
