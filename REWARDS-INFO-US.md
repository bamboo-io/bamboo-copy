# Everything You Need to Know About BAM Rewards

## What is BAM Rewards?

BAM Rewards is our native rewards program on the Bamboo platform.

## What is BAM Rewards?

Bamboo gives users the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of BAM tokens. 

BAM tokens are awarded to users based on in-app activity and can be sold for cash whenever the user desires, proportionate to their portfolio.

## How Do I start receiving BAM rewards?

1. Turn the **‘Activate Rewards’** button in the rewards section of the app.

2. Allocate 2% of their portfolio to BAM, at a value of at least $50.

3. Continue to maintain at least 2% of BAM in portfolio mix. EG: 48% Bitcoin, 48% Ethereum, 4% BAM

## How do users earn BAM tokens?

BAM tokens can be earned in the following quantities, by performing the following activity within the app:


|Activity|BAM Rewards Value|
|------|-------------|
|Make a $50 Top Up |1.5 BAM per top-up|
|Turn on Recurring Top-Ups|4 BAM per month|
|Refer a friend|5 BAM per referral|

## Important Additional Information:

*If a user has enabled BAM Rewards, but not allocated at least 2% BAM in their portfolio mix, what happens?*

Once a user enables BAM Rewards, **they must maintain 2% of BAM in their portfolio mix to earn BAM rewards**.

If the user hasn’t allocated at least 2% BAM to the users portfolio, Bamboo will automatically add the necessary BAM to an investment event (round up, top-up or recurring investment) to maintain at least 2% BAM in the portfolio mix. 

**This means those withdrawals may be more than anticipated,** in order to enable the user to continue earning BAM rewards and get paid out, if and when the user wishes to cash in their BAM tokens. 

To avoid larger than anticipated investments, users must ensure that they manually add at least 2% BAM into their portfolio mix after they have activated BAM rewards. For example: 48% Bitcoin, 48% Ethereum, 4% BAM.

## FAQs

**Can I redeem/sell BAM?**

You can sell BAM at any time proportionally to your portfolio.

**Can I transfer my BAM on/off the App?**

No, Bamboo is a ‘closed loop’ system meaning users can only sell their digital assets to a linked bank account.
