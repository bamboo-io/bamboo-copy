# About Transaction Report

Whether you're an individual user or an SMSF investor, we provide flexible options for accessing and exporting your tax reports. Here are the available export formats:

1. **PDF** – A detailed PDF spreadsheet view of your transactions and summaries.  
2. **CSV** – A detailed CSV spreadsheet view of your transactions and summaries.  
3. **Summ CSV** – A pre-formatted file you can upload directly into Summ to streamline your tax preparation.

**Note:** First time sending your Bamboo data to Summ? Upload your *entire* transaction history, so Summ will calculate cost basis and gains accurately; after that you can upload by date range.

Bonus: **Save 25 % on your first year** – enter the promo code **BAMBOO** at any plan checkout on the Summ website.

## For SMSF Users

If you manage a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF), you'll need to prepare specific reports for tax purposes at the end of each financial year.

**Guide for SMSF account owners:**

1. **Export your transaction report**  
   - Set the report format to **Summ CSV** and tap **Continue**.
   - **First-time export:** select “**Since start**” so Summ receives your full transaction history and can establish an accurate cost base. 
   - **Later exports:** choose the specific financial year you need.

2. **Use [Summ](https://home.cryptotaxcalculator.io/au)**  
   - Upload the Summ CSV file directly into the software.  
   - It will automatically categorise transactions and you can then generate your tax reports.
   - Consult your tax advisor to ensure compliance with current taxation laws. The information provided does not take into account individual taxpayers' circumstances, and we are unable to provide tax advice.

3. **Need Help?**

If you're working with an accountant, simply send them the exported file.
